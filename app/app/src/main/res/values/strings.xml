    <string name="story_text">Arnold is a robotic suitcase that takes the hassle out of the traveling experience by doing everything you would wish a smart luggage would do, and much more! It is also very easy to use and can be used both as an assistive robot meant to help disabled people with difficulties to carry their belongings, and as a travel companion to ease frequent travelers from pulling their heavy luggage, while making sure to always stay by their side.</string>
